Program script that uses gphoto2 to perform tethered shooting and downloading photos from a camera, either through Wi-Fi or USB connection.
The script takes an argument to determine which function should be executed.

Here's a brief explanation of the script's functions:

tethered_wifi: Performs tethered shooting over Wi-Fi and stores photos in the specified folder.
tethered_wifi_beta: Continuously checks for a connection with the camera and performs tethered shooting over Wi-Fi when connected.
tethered_wifi_hook: Performs tethered shooting over Wi-Fi using a hook script.
tethered_usb: Performs tethered shooting over USB and stores photos in the specified folder.
tethered_usb_hook: Performs tethered shooting over USB using a hook script.
download_wifi: Continuously checks for a connection with the camera and downloads all photos from the camera over Wi-Fi, skipping existing files.
download_usb: Downloads all photos from the camera over USB, skipping existing files.
The script checks the given argument and calls the corresponding function. If there's no argument or the argument is invalid, the script exits.
